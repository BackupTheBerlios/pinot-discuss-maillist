Subject: [Pinot-discuss] Pinot: 1st look and suggestions

Hi all,
I came across Pinot and it looks good, so far.

I am primarily searching for a replacment for a personal search proxy
which I have been running for a while called Mindretrieve
(http://www.mindretrieve.net/), which indexes every web page a user visits
automatically. However Mindretrieve is a bit of a memory monster (with a
large index)....

Seeing how Pinot (and Pinot-dbus-deamon) treats File scans and Web imports
as seperate indexes (or at least catogories), does the idea of adding a
third 'web seen' catagory make sense?

A small proxy could parse/index all the webpages seen and push the result
into xapian index.

Am I mad?
Mungewell.

Thanks for the link, I didn't know about Mindretrieve... What you
describe is definitely possible. A Web proxy or browser extension
could feed documents to Pinot for indexing. No such proxy or extension
exists right now though.
If you only wanted to index Web pages of interest, I would recommend
using Firefox' Scrapbook extension and adding your scrapbook directory
to the list of directories to index.
I see that Mindretrieve is under the BSD license. In theory, one could
replace its Lucene back-end with Xapian, and search the resulting
index with Pinot. There are several Python-based toolkits that allow
indexing and searching with Xapian.

Does this help ?
