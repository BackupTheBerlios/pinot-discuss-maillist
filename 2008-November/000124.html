<PRE>Hi John,

Sorry for the late reply.

&gt;<i> The upgrade and reindexing is finally done. The results are:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Great. 4 days is still too long though. I ought to take some time and
profile the daemon.

&gt;<i> - The check for changed files took much less time after I restarted
</I>&gt;<i>  pinot. (But I disabled atime for my file systems after I upgraded to
</I>&gt;<i>  0.89. Don't know how much it takes with enabled access time.)
</I>&gt;<i> - The database doubled in size after the upgrade. (see below)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, these figures look much more like what I would expect.

&gt;<i> - I had another weird problem: pinot used nearly all memory up but did
</I>&gt;<i>  not progress. The problem didn't reappear. 2 bt's are displayed
</I>&gt;<i>  below. The first is before indexing failed, the second
</I>&gt;<i>  after it did.
</I>&gt;<i>  At that time, daemon/ didn't seem to grow, but history-daemon had
</I>&gt;<i>  a lot of activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hmm unfortunately I couldn't make much of the backtraces. Did
history-daemon grow in size while this was happening ?
