</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why should it matter how many files I want to index? :-P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>For one thing, the size of the cache maintained by Xapian depends on
the number of documents (up to XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD) but mainly
because memory allocations are performed every time a file is
processed.
A large number of small files may lead to a large number of small
buffers, and small buffers are sometimes not reclaimed by the OS.
There's an explanation of this at
<A HREF="http://xmlsoft.org/xmlmem.html#Compacting">http://xmlsoft.org/xmlmem.html#Compacting</A>
Large free buffers of memory between used buffers may not be reclaimed
by the OS either.
The STL also maintains a memory pool. You could try exporting the
environment variable &quot;GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW&quot; to disable this pool.

&gt;<i> &quot;My boyfriend plugged his external hard disk into my system, the leds

</I>&gt;<i> fabrice, you know so much about computers and are my best friend.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *bambi eyes*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Your girlfriend shouldn't worry. This won't happen, only because Pinot
doesn't attempt to automatically index new media when mounted.

&gt;&gt;<i> More seriously, if the final index size is around 1.6Gb it may not be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unrealistic for memory usage to be around 3+ Gb. Did 0.90 (release)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and older versions take much more ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but the bug where files where forgotten if the daemon got
</I>&gt;<i> interrupted/oom'd while I was away hid it very well as most of the
</I>&gt;<i> problematic files would get forgotten in one go and probably indexed at
</I>&gt;<i> a much later point in time if that happened at all ;-) (And I have so
</I>&gt;<i> many files I wouldn't probably realize it for a long time)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Indeed.

&gt;&gt;<i> I seem to remember your system has 1Gb of memory, and your corpus has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 400k documents. I couldn't find the total on-disk size of your corpus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my mail archive, but you would probably be better off staging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indexing in smaller chunks, restarting the daemon between each stage,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and running xapian-compact on the final index.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Naw, that is too much work. If it can't work in the background without
</I>&gt;<i> my monitoring, it's completely useless (and dangerous).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also the problem that I didn't tell it to index everything in
</I>&gt;<i> this test. The test ran only over &gt;58k of my documents (pdfs, txt, ps,
</I>&gt;<i> html) in a flat directory hierarchy. The restart interrupted it and
</I>&gt;<i> only 22k got indexed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>How big were these files on disk, and how big was the resulting index
(before restart) ?

&gt;<i> But it used already 1.8/0.7 GB after a short time so it's probably not
</I>&gt;<i> bound to the number of documents. Probably 5k large files could be
</I>&gt;<i> enough to get pinot running out of bounds. Do I want to test that?
</I>&gt;<i> Probably not :-D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, you do ! :-) Otherwise how are we going to get to grip with this ?
I am not aware of Pinot running &quot;out of bounds&quot;.

&gt;<i> I'm not expecting it to work great right now, but it's still a
</I>&gt;<i> background service for desktop users (or did I assume the wrong target
</I>&gt;<i> group/usage method?) which shouldn't interrupt a users work. This
</I>&gt;<i> includes eating up his system ressources if he needs them for other
</I>&gt;<i> things. So I consider pinots goal to behave like one in v1.00.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, it's a desktop service, but it's focused on being nice and
non-disruptive after initial indexing.
Not much effort has gone into reducing the impact of initial indexing,
partly because of limited resources (time on my part). One consequence
is that by default it's not configured to index anything, and requires
user configuration.

&gt;<i> As a hard bound: if I can't tweak it too use a specific numbers of
</I>&gt;<i> mbyte and set it as low as 50-100 mbyte or tell it to not use memory
</I>&gt;<i> other processes need it's useless for me (even if I had something like
</I>&gt;<i> 128 GByte RAM and a 32 core system - and then probably around 2 billion
</I>&gt;<i> files). Maybe I would give it more memory if it is all alone, but if I
</I>&gt;<i> want to use my system it should only use the minimum possible and
</I>&gt;<i> behave nice as it already does in regards to cpu ressources (setting
</I>&gt;<i> itself to 15/idle).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>To achieve this, Pinot would have to have its own memory manager. I
don't have the knowledge, nor the bandwidth, to undertake this kind of
work.

&gt;<i> That's also why I'm sending my results (not because I expect 0.91 to
</I>&gt;<i> work awesome, I know pinot is far from ready). As far as I think:
</I>&gt;<i> if it can't be done without using memory other processes need and I
</I>&gt;<i> have to monitor it the whole time, it shouldn't be a background process
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't agree.
It's the OS job to know what memory other processes need. What we
could do though is to fix leaks and identify problematic usage
patterns.

&gt;<i> Think of a user whose desktop freezes suddenly because his distribution
</I>&gt;<i> installed pinot for him and activated it by default because it's
</I>&gt;<i> useful. He only needs 5k files with a lot of text and *bang* system
</I>&gt;<i> dead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's not possible. Activating Pinot won't trigger any indexing.
Per-user configuration is required.

You need to tell us more about those 5k files you mention. It sounds
to me like you have a good test case.

&gt;<i> I'm not worried about reindexing, I know I have many files and it
</I>&gt;<i> will take days. And I know the process will probably be refined in the
</I>&gt;<i> future (and improvements in other programs will probably make it
</I>&gt;<i> easier).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Then why are you worried about indexing ? ;-)

&gt;<i> Only indexing parts of a document? I don't know if that is good. If it
</I>&gt;<i> is needed to get it running for now, I will go with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's common practice. That's enough to extract what the document is about.

&gt;<i> To make a long story short: if I can't savely use it, even if it is not
</I>&gt;<i> feature complete, I can't use it as it's disruptive. If you think it
</I>&gt;<i> will take a lot more time to fix it up or it isn't for me, I will stay
</I>&gt;<i> back and maybe come back later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You can use it safely as long as you understand the consequences of
what you tell it to do. Throwing a large number of files to the
indexer on a system with limited resources has consequences.

I can't promise miracles. I can only promise working with you to the
best of my abilities and limited time to come up with solutions and
work-arounds.
