Nothing :D Probably the system was so hard working reading from/to disk
that it just had no time to consider doing nothing instead.

&gt;<i> I am starting to think you may be trying to index too many documents
</I>&gt;<i> in one go, with too few resources ;-)
</I>
Why should it matter how many files I want to index? :-P

&quot;My boyfriend plugged his external hard disk into my system, the leds
started to blink like crazy and now everything is dead. Can you help me
fabrice, you know so much about computers and are my best friend.&quot;
*bambi eyes*

&gt;<i> More seriously, if the final index size is around 1.6Gb it may not be
</I>&gt;<i> unrealistic for memory usage to be around 3+ Gb. Did 0.90 (release)
</I>&gt;<i> and older versions take much more ?
</I>
Yes, but the bug where files where forgotten if the daemon got
interrupted/oom'd while I was away hid it very well as most of the
problematic files would get forgotten in one go and probably indexed at
a much later point in time if that happened at all ;-) (And I have so
many files I wouldn't probably realize it for a long time)

&gt;<i> I seem to remember your system has 1Gb of memory, and your corpus has
</I>&gt;<i> 400k documents. I couldn't find the total on-disk size of your corpus
</I>&gt;<i> in my mail archive, but you would probably be better off staging
</I>&gt;<i> indexing in smaller chunks, restarting the daemon between each stage,
</I>&gt;<i> and running xapian-compact on the final index.
</I>
Naw, that is too much work. If it can't work in the background without
my monitoring, it's completely useless (and dangerous).

There is also the problem that I didn't tell it to index everything in
this test. The test ran only over &gt;58k of my documents (pdfs, txt, ps,
html) in a flat directory hierarchy. The restart interrupted it and
only 22k got indexed.

But it used already 1.8/0.7 GB after a short time so it's probably not
bound to the number of documents. Probably 5k large files could be
enough to get pinot running out of bounds. Do I want to test that?
Probably not :-D

&gt;<i> I am not saying I am giving up on this. I do want to keep a lid on
</I>&gt;<i> resource consumption.
</I>
I'm not expecting it to work great right now, but it's still a
background service for desktop users (or did I assume the wrong target
group/usage method?) which shouldn't interrupt a users work. This
includes eating up his system ressources if he needs them for other
things. So I consider pinots goal to behave like one in v1.00.

As a hard bound: if I can't tweak it too use a specific numbers of
mbyte and set it as low as 50-100 mbyte or tell it to not use memory
other processes need it's useless for me (even if I had something like
128 GByte RAM and a 32 core system - and then probably around 2 billion
files). Maybe I would give it more memory if it is all alone, but if I
want to use my system it should only use the minimum possible and
behave nice as it already does in regards to cpu ressources (setting
itself to 15/idle).

That's also why I'm sending my results (not because I expect 0.91 to
work awesome, I know pinot is far from ready). As far as I think:
if it can't be done without using memory other processes need and I
have to monitor it the whole time, it shouldn't be a background process
in the first place.

Think of a user whose desktop freezes suddenly because his distribution
installed pinot for him and activated it by default because it's
useful. He only needs 5k files with a lot of text and *bang* system
dead.

&gt;<i> Before releasing 0.91, I'll modify the indexing code to only consider
</I>&gt;<i> the first 5Mb. I am thinking I should also add a mean to disable
</I>&gt;<i> automatic index upgrades for cases like yours where reindexing means
</I>&gt;<i> days, and think how indexing could be staged automatically based on
</I>&gt;<i> memory usage.
</I>
I'm not worried about reindexing, I know I have many files and it
will take days. And I know the process will probably be refined in the
future (and improvements in other programs will probably make it
easier).

Only indexing parts of a document? I don't know if that is good. If it
is needed to get it running for now, I will go with it.

&gt;<i> By the way, did the log file have many messages of the type
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ExternalFilter::run_command: stopping at &quot; ?
</I>
The log got killed by an instance which ran automatically later, I
enabled pinot in my autostart as the first tests made it look stable :-/


To make a long story short: if I can't savely use it, even if it is not
feature complete, I can't use it as it's disruptive. If you think it
will take a lot more time to fix it up or it isn't for me, I will stay
back and maybe come back later.


long mail :-/

John
