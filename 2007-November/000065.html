<PRE>Hi Andreas,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay. Is this with desktop-file-install &gt; 0.12 ?
I'll update the desktop files.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You may want to exit the UI and delete .pinot/index/flintlock to get rid of the
&quot;can't open index&quot; message. I'll add that to the FAQ.

The crash you experienced is a known problem. We have seen it happen
on some systems. What version of dbus and dbus-glib does ArchLinux have ?
If Gabriel is reading this, he can probably tell us what versions of the above
he installed to get rid of the crash...

</I>&gt;<i> I have an athlon64 3000 with one Gig RAM. I noticed on indexing that RAM

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You're right.
Flushing is not directly configurable in Pinot. The environment variable
XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD can be set to the number of documents
after which Xapian should flush changes to the index. The default value is
set to 10000 I believe.
pinot-dbus-daemon explicitely flushes the index once it has crawled a
directory (directory configured in Preferences, Indexing).

&gt;<i> All of the above is for --enable-debug=yes. RAM/Swap usage is much better
</I>&gt;<i> now, however! While Swap is being used (I have a kernel with low
</I>&gt;<i> swappiness), this is half a gig and Ram is only ever at most about half filled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oops. Right now I have several errors in the status window, all of which like
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't retrieve document - <A HREF="file:///path/to/some_doc?ment_with_qu?stionmarks.html">file:///path/to/some_doc?ment_with_qu?stionmarks.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (the names are with umlauts or apostrophes and I can't figure out the
</I>&gt;<i> filename encoding. Normally I have utf-8, but then 'ls' wouldn't throw these
</I>&gt;<i> questionmarks at me. mvconv doesn't want to change a thing about those
</I>&gt;<i> filename...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah good catch. I'll look into this.

&gt;<i> It has finished indexing after some 20 minutes (forgot to time it and had to
</I>&gt;<i> leave before it had finished) now and here's the du:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pinot-discuss">wagner at apollo</A> ~]$ du -hsc ~/.pinot/daemon/*
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 168M    /home/wagner/.pinot/daemon/spelling.DB
</I>&gt;<i> 4,0K    /home/wagner/.pinot/daemon/spelling.baseA
</I>&gt;<i> 4,0K    /home/wagner/.pinot/daemon/spelling.baseB
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 464M    insgesamt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks better now, innit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes it does ! If I am not mistaken, your first try was with Xapian
1.0.3, right ?
That version had a bug which prevented zlib compression from working.
This probably explains why now your index is so much smaller.

Thanks for your feedback, it's very much appreciated. Let us know
if you run into any other issue.

Fabrice
