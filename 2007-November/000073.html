Hi all,
sorry for not responding earlier. Tuesday I have sumbitted my PhD thesis and now I am very slowly sorting out what to 
do next (and how much and where I am getting my time from).

I had the comp running for another 2 days and when I finally powered off, pinot-dbus-daemon was still using some 20% 
of my RAM -- I suppose it gave away the other 20% without resistence when something else needed it. (But I did miss 
the moment, I must admit.)

A propos testing/stable. The weird mix of packages probably comes from the fact that at one point I had used &quot;testing&quot; 
as primary repository, but got a bit afraid when the submission deadline was drawing nearer. At that point, I haven't 
disabled it, but put it at the end of the repositories to be checked. So I suppose only when the core/extra repos have 
a newer version will those from testing be cleaned. Peu &#224; peu.

I have just dl'ed the snapshot and I'm going to try it some of these days (sorry I can't be more specific. My schedule 
has also to be sorted out with the family :rolleyes:). I am going to have it re-index anyway and try to pay more 
attention to more exact metrics.
And I'll first see if the crash is happening again (I didn't try a second time up to now), before I try with 
dbus-1.1.2. (Tho I wonder that there's no update in any of the Arch Locations -- neither for xapian. Oh well.).


BTW, in case I wasn't clear enough: the filenames probably messed up in my filesystem. I'll verify and report when I 
have the snapshot up.

Cheers,
Andreas
