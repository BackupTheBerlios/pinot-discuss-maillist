<PRE>Scanned a bigger part of my filesystem and got thrashed again. I
tried to find out what happened, made some tests and these are the
results:

checking html/image files:
- memory usage was always below 20 MB

checking txt files:
- memory usage went slowly up from 14 MB to 70 MB over the course of
  all 4400 rfc's

checking pdf files:
- The worst offender was a pdf file which left 140 MB lying around
  after I scanned it alone and would run out of memory in memcheck.
  Other files weren't that bad, but memory usage increased steadily
  over time and didn't went down after the daemon was finished. Doing a
  memcheck on some of them yielded nothing new.

zip files:
- Ate more memory than txt files, but didn't delve to deep as pdfs were
  much worse.

There are a lot more file types which I could have checked but these are
the ones that I encountered a lot short before pinot ran out of memory.
