Hi Richard,

You would just select the search engine of your choice in the engines
list on the left
and either click the Find button next to Query, or the one right to
the stored queries
list if you are using a stored query.

What's the error message you get ?

Are you connected directly to the Internet ? If proxy configuration is
required, Web
searches will not work in the current version.

Hello,

I just compiled Pinot 0.64 from source on a Gentoo linux machine.  The
compilation went OK but I get this error when I do 'make install':

/usr/local/share/applications/pinot.desktop: error: Categories values

The solution is in the FAQ ;)

snip

.....

* If "make install" fails with an error about Categories in pinot.desktop
and you have desktop-file-utils 0.11, either downgrade to 0.10 or
upgrade to 0.12
if possible, or edit the top-level Makefile and replace the line
@desktop-file-install --vendor=""
--dir=$(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications pinot.desktop
with
$(INSTALL_DATA) pinot.desktop
$(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications/pinot.desktop
and run "make install" again.

.....

Another workaround is to remove "Application" from the "Categories"
field in pinot.desktop.
That change was actually committed to the trunk recently, you can get
the file from
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/pinot/trunk/pinot.desktop?op=file&rev=0&sc=0

BTW, for 0.64, I would recommend you apply the corrective patch at
http://pinot.berlios.de/fixes_064_01.patch

Coincidentally, I am planning to release 0.65 later on today.

Cheers.

hello,

I have pinot-0.65 installed and running.  I worked through the docs on
the web page and was able to generate hits for a couple of terms.
However, I cannot get pinot to index my home directory.  I followed
the instructions on the web page but after I do

pinot-dbus-daemon &

followed by

pinot-search xapian ~/.pinot/daemon "calcite" 10

I see: Couldn't get a results list !

and pinot-dbus-daemon.log says

TokenizerFactory::loadTokenizers: /home/rmason/.pinot/tokenizers
doesn't exist
Couldn't open bus connection: Unable to determine the address of the
message bus (try 'man dbus-launch' and 'man dbus-daemon'$
Exiting...

Thanks for any help,

Roger

Well I wonder what Distro you are using ..
If you have some /etc/profile.d/ folder ( or alike ) add dbus.sh file in
there. Like this one :

#!/bin/sh

dbuslaunch="`which dbus-launch 2>/dev/null`"
if [ "`whoami`" != "root" ]; then
if [ -n "$dbuslaunch" ] && [ -x "$dbuslaunch" ] && [ -z
"$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ]; then
eval `$dbuslaunch --auto-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi
fi

chmod +x the file , logout and login again with your user.

If you now do ps aux you should see something like this :

your_user ...... 0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-launch --auto-syntax --exit-with-session
your_user ...... 0:00 /usr/bin/dbus-daemon --fork --print-pid 4
--print-address 6 --session

The important bit here is the "dbus-daemon" process running with "--session".
If this process is not running, there is no session bus to which
pinot-dbus-daemon can
connect and it will exit almost immediately and not crawl and index anything.

Hi,

I just indexed my home directory and afterwards ran the query:

pinot-search xapian ~/.pinot/daemon "crystal" 1000

This returned about 20 hits.  However, in one of my subdirectories I
have a number of pdf documents that contain the keyword crystal: none
of them have been found and I'm wondering why?

Thanks for your help,

Roger

P.S. I checked one of the "missing" documents with pdftotext to make
sure it was not a pdf image file and that it contains the stem
"crystal".

Yes! That was it.  Thanks.  I was able to index (most of) my home
dir.  I'll post another question regrding the "most of".

Thanks for your help.

First thing is to verify whether all these documents are actually in the index.
Run pinot and select the menuitem Index, List Contents Of, My Documents.
Can you see all your PDFs in there ? You can also run a search for "ext:pdf"
and/or "dir:/home/roger/mypdfdir", either using pinot-search or a Stored Query
in pinot, with "Number Of Results" set suitably high.

Let us know what you find out.
