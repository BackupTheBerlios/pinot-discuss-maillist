Hi, everyone.

I'm doing some research and Pinot is a great tool to search in many academic places.
I have a problem with ERIC (http://www.eric.ed.gov). They use capitalized params on the query URL, and the Sherlock parser doesn't work well with they.

My engine is:

<search 
   name="ERIC"
   description="Educational Resources Information Center"
   method="GET"
   action="http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal"
   updateCheckDays=1   
   routeType="Research"
>

<input name="ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0" user>
<input name="ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0" value="kw">
<input name="_nfpb" value="true">

<input name="_pageLabel" value="ERICSearchResult">
<input name="rnd" value="0">
<input name="newSearch" value="true">
<input name="searchtype" value="basic">
<input name="sourceid" value="Mozilla-search">
<inputnext name="eric_displayStartCount" factor="1">
<inputprev name="eric_displayStartCount" factor="1">

<interpret 
    browserResultType="result" 
    resultListStart="Use My Clipboard to print" 
    resultListEnd="Now showing results" 
    resultItemStart="tblSearchResult"
    resultItemEnd="</p>"
>
</search>


And the log for "educational" is

<search 
   name="ERIC"
   description="Educational Resources Information Center"
   method="GET"
   action="http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal"
   updateCheckDays=1   
   routeType="Research"
>

<input name="ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0" user>
<input name="ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0" value="kw">
<input name="_nfpb" value="true">

<input name="_pageLabel" value="ERICSearchResult">
<input name="rnd" value="0">
<input name="newSearch" value="true">
<input name="searchtype" value="basic">
<input name="sourceid" value="Mozilla-search">
<inputnext name="eric_displayStartCount" factor="1">
<inputprev name="eric_displayStartCount" factor="1">

<interpret 
    browserResultType="result" 
    resultListStart="Use My Clipboard to print" 
    resultListEnd="Now showing results" 
    resultItemStart="tblSearchResult"
    resultItemEnd="</p>"
>
</search>

The log for curl is:

CurlDownloader::retrieveUrl: URL is http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/Home.portal?ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=educational&_nfpb=true&_pagelabel=ERICSearchResult&ericextsearch_searchtype_0=kw&ericextsearch_searchvalue_0=Research&newsearch=true&rnd=0&searchtype=basic&sourceid=Mozilla-search&eric_displayStartCount=0

As you can see, "ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0" was used twice, first time capitalized and second time on lowercase.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Claudio,

Sorry for the late reply, I was travelling.

You're right. The user input item is used twice.

What OS/distro are you using ? Are you comfortable with compiling from source
and applying patches ?
I have attached a patch for SherlockParser.cpp that should fix this problem.

Let me know if this works for you. Thanks.

Fabrice

Gentoo

Yes, of course. Compiling, making ebuilds and applying a lot of patches!

I looked the code and try to make some changes, but I don't be good on C++

Cool!
