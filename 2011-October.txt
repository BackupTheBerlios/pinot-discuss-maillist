Subject: [Pinot-discuss] Can't index PDF and DjVu documents
Message-ID: <CAA-8Ld_ACJJ88Rn3ookQMVmR6Oah_rB36VFMLGLfcWuWLF+F9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm relatively new to Linux. I used Pinot on previous PC with Ubuntu 11.04
and everything was as it's supposed to be

Now I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on another PC and Pinot 0.96 from Synaptic. I
have `pdftotext` and `djvutxt` programs
In preferences I selected 3 folders for monitoring:

/sympath-to/CHM
/sympath-to/PDF
/sympath-to/DJVU

which root is symbolic link, and another folder:

/path-to/PDF

Now I'm almost sure that symbolic links have nothing to do with my problem
as I didn't have any problems before, but I thought to explain in details
anyway.

Problem is that Pinot indexes only CHM files.
When I launch GUI and choose to see indexed documents, only CHM files are
present.
I double checked with search for terms present in PDF files and I got no
results.
However I noticed that `pdftotext` indexes files with `top` tool or `System
Monitor` in couple of occasions, like on system start-up, or when I close
Pinot GUI configuration or on idle I guess

So what can be issue here? Maybe if fails on some file or similar but where
are already indexed files? Not mentioning DjVu files.

Also I would like to ask another question if you don't mind - as Recoll uses
same search engine and db I got idea to use both tools in some configuration
that suites me best.

Currently Recoll indexes my files (same as those set in Pinot)
Recoll doesn't have index daemon (though I could make incrond action)

Is there some best way of using both indexers without doing things twice?


Thanks in advance

Is there anything that distinguish your CHM files from your PDF and DJVU files ?
Permissions, maybe ?
Note that the actual content of CHM files can't be indexed by current
releases. A CHM filter is planned for version 0.98.

Is this with the List Contents Of, My Documents menu ?

Did you try looking for PDF files specifically ? For instance
"ext:pdf" will return files with extension ".pdf".

Try the following :
- double check the patterns list in the Indexing tab of Preferences
doesn't exclude the extensions you are interested in (eg "*.pdf").
- verify that /etc/pinot/external-filters.xml has entries for
"application/pdf" and "image/vnd.djvu". You may want to try running
the corresponding "command" element manually in the shell against any
of the files you expect to be indexed, and see what the output looks
like. For instance, "pdftotext -enc UTF-8 -raw PDF_FILE_HERE -"
- make sure these files are readable for the user account for which
the Pinot daemon runs.
- look for suspicious messages or errors in the Options, Status window
and in the daemon's log at ~/.pinot/pinot-dbus-daemon.log

Yes, Recoll and Pinot both use Xapian.
Any Xapian index can be added as an external index to Pinot, using the
big "+" button at the bottom of the Search Engines pane, so you could
actually query indexes built with Recoll from the Pinot UI.
That's as far as it goes; last I heard files were not indexed by
Recoll in the same manner as in Pinot. Simple free text queries
against Recoll indexes should work, but those with filters may or may
not work.

If you think that Pinot misses any feature that Recoll currently has,
let me know. I could look into implementing it.
