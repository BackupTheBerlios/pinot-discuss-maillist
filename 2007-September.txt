Subject: [Pinot-discuss] A patch for 0.76
Message-ID: <6538c8c80709050708x762a320x76338d09d816c847@mail.gmail.com>

There's a problem in 0.76 related to dbus, more specifically,
the new Reload method that is invoked by the Preferences dialog.
In some cases, it could cause pinot to segfault when pressing
the Ok button in Preferences.
The patch at http://pinot.berlios.de/dbusxapianindex_reload03.patch
should fix this issue, as well as some confusion about the value of
the DBUS_VERSION macro.
