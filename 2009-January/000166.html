Ok, here some results. I did 4 tests, one without interruption, 3 with
interruption at different times (10 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes). I
compiled pinot from svn r1509.

The test procedure was as follows:
1) $ rm .pinot -rf
2) $ pinot # initialize without any file patterns and labels
3) $ pinot-dbus-daemon
4) Interrupt after the given time
5) - create backup of .pinot
   - $ find -P /home/jwerden/test -exec pinot-check-file.sh {} \; &gt; pinot_&lt;time&gt;_1.missing
6) $ pinot-dbus-daemon
7) if done, interrupt daemon
8) - create backup of .pinot
   - $ find -P /home/jwerden/test -exec pinot-check-file.sh {} \; &gt; pinot_&lt;time&gt;_2.missing
   - $ lua comp.lua pinot_&lt;time&gt;_1.missing \
                    pinot_&lt;time&gt;_2.missing \
                    pinot_&lt;time&gt;_exclusive.1 \
                    pinot_&lt;time&gt;_exclusive.2 \
                    pinot_&lt;time&gt;_shared

&lt;time&gt; gets replaced with 10sec, 2min, 5min.

comp.lua takes 2 input files and finds out which files are only listed
in file 1, which in file 2 and which ones are listed in both.

For the test without interruption steps 5 to 9 are omitted.

test results:

without interruption:
indexed files: 3543
missing files: 0

after 10 seconds:
missing files at (5): 3427
missing files at (8): 177
files not missing at (5), but at (8): 0

after 2 minutes:
missing files at (5): 3185
missing files at (8): 1368
files not missing at (5), but at (8): 0

after 5 minutes (short before done):
missing files at (5): 1507
missing files at (8): 1331
files not missing at (5), but at (8): 0


To find out if the problem is related to hard/softlinks I made some
simple tests in another directory. I used the pinot GUI client to find
out how many files got indexed. The directory contains a flat hierarchy
of directories which in turn contain most likely only images. I didn't
take any backups of the database from the tests.

full scan without interrupt: 15021
first try (short time until break): 15018
second try (not as short): 14858
third try (even longer): 15018

I cannot guarantee that there are only image files in the directories or
only specific MIME types, but I know there are no hard/soft links at
all.

From these results I can conclude the following:
- The problem is not related to hard/soft links.
- The problem does not need deep directory hierarchies to appear.
- The daemon does not lose files it already got before termination.

I cannot conclude:
- The problem is unrelated to the file type.

I could do a lot more testing, but I need your opinion first because
the tests take _time_ and you know much better what to test and what
not.

If you want to get more information about the MIME types of the fetched
files I need to know what you exactly want and how to retrieve the
information. Best is a fast script which takes a file as input which
contains a list of files which should get checked for the MIME type.

I have the complete backups of the first 4 tests if you want me to
retrieve more information from them.

Sidenote: The shell script you provided leads to false positives if a
file name contains multiple spaces in a row. But that problem didn't
change anything because the test case did not include any files with
spaces.
