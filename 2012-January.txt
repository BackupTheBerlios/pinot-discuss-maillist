Subject: [Pinot-discuss] Pinot dbus deamon stop indexing
Message-ID: <CACxpABGzPHcNNYzH=MUwX2P6uBm-JAnK--GL=cvt11=nKhg6tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody, I'm new in the list, my name is German and I'm from
Argentina.

The last day I would make a search engine based on web, with pinot, I need
the console mode interface, installed pinot ( from official ubuntu 11.10
repos ), then configured it with prefs.xml and launched the
pinot-dbus-deamon, well, this was working fine, was searching my files and
everything, the last day, I added a new file, and just died the indexing
stuff.

The log says:

gbortoli at development ~% cat .pinot/pinot-dbus-daemon.log

Hi!
Something is up with history-daemon... Could you delete it and restart the daemon?
Also note that battery status affects indexing, not search, but better check that document is in your index using Pinot's List Contents Of menu.
