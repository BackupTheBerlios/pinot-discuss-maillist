<PRE>Hi John,

</I>&gt;<i> Pinot needed ~2 days to index all my files, tracker needed 3 days,
</I>&gt;<i> but it would have taken another 10 days WITHOUT turning the machine
</I>&gt;<i> off or stopping tracker (worst case, I don't know) to built the
</I>&gt;<i> final index.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both don't use much memory. I did not change the inotify
</I>&gt;<i> configuration, which makes it highly possible, that pinot does not
</I>&gt;<i> watch all files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>In the list of directories to index, if the Monitor checkbox is
activated for your docs directory, Pinot will attempt to monitor all
files in that directory. There's a limit on the number of files a
process can watch with inotify, so most probably not all your 400k
files will be watched. The Status window won't show any error for this
though.

&gt;<i> I can't compare the search speed, because tracker doesn't seem to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to show all search results while the final index is built
</I>&gt;<i> and I had to drop it because of this problem, before I could test
</I>&gt;<i> all its capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay. Being able to search while indexing is a big plus that Xapian gives us.

&gt;<i> For me, it would be enough if I could check some box 'search for
</I>&gt;<i> similar words' or use a button [list similar] and choose from a
</I>&gt;<i> displayed list of similar queries. But this is more about taste,
</I>&gt;<i> because it annoys me to death if a search engine tells me what to
</I>&gt;<i> search for (worse, if the corrections are WRONG or plain stupid
</I>&gt;<i> which makes me facepalm).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea with clicking on a possible alternative (not correction!)
</I>&gt;<i> isn't bad, if it adds something for the user like enhanced queries.
</I>&gt;<i> At least it's much better than how it works right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the idea to correct/educate the user itself (except he wants
</I>&gt;<i> it) is bad, because it says implicitly 'you are stupid'. Enhancing
</I>&gt;<i> his _possibilities_ on the other side is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree, and will look into changing how alternative spellings are suggested.

&gt;&gt;<i> Did you find indexing was much slower with spelling enabled ? How much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bigger was your index at ~/.pinot/daemon when spelling was enabled ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it wasn't much slower for me. I can only give highly subjective
</I>&gt;<i> answers, but I think it would have taken maybe 4 days at worst case
</I>&gt;<i> for building the index instead of 2. Maybe it would have taken the
</I>&gt;<i> same amount of time as without the dictionary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I remember the dictionary had the size ratio as told in
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation. Right now the complete dictionary
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.pinot/daemon is 780 MiByte large. But I have a lot of free
</I>&gt;<i> GiBytes free, I would not care if it uses several of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Is that the size of the spelling database at
~/.pinot/daemon/spelling.DB ? What about the whole index ?
How much space do your documents take on the disk, altogether ?
If your documents collection is static, you could try compacting the
index at ~/.pinot/daemon with xapian-compact. See the FAQ
(<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/pinot/trunk/FAQ">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/pinot/trunk/FAQ</A>). It will take a long a
while to compact such a big index though.

&gt;&gt;<i> Did you try using stored queries to filter the index list while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> browsing. If you choose the &quot;Index, List Contents Of My Documents&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> menu, this will list all your documents. This list can be filtered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a stored query, using the combo box next to the Previous and Next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buttons. In this case, the query's maximum number of results doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> apply. This should allow you to get the complete list of documents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matching the query.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I just found out how to use the stored query feature with 'My
</I>&gt;<i> Documents'. It seems inconsistent, because first I tried it with
</I>&gt;<i> opening 'My Documents' and running the stored query out of the 'v
</I>&gt;<i> Stored Queries' Subwindow. Only later did I see that you have to
</I>&gt;<i> use select the stored query from a drop down menu, instead of just
</I>&gt;<i> running it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I know you described how to do it in complete here, but I came to
</I>&gt;<i> the first line and was already all over pinot instead of reading
</I>&gt;<i> the whole paragraph, but it still shows that the GUI is too
</I>&gt;<i> complex).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There's several reasons for the limit on the number of results, and
the existence of search and browse modes :
- it's not practical to show thousands of results in the results
tree/list. The GUI would become sluggish and unresponsive.
- for full text searches, usually the desired documents are in the top
10 or 20 results.
- search mode is designed for viewing results, comparing results
between engines, digging deeper with More Like or Search This For, and
indexing results locally
- browse mode is designed for exploring the corpus, viewing documents
and editing their properties (labels, metadata...)
Anyway, I am not saying it's perfect. As you point out, there's a lot
of room for improvement.

&gt;&gt;<i> Did you find you had to edit the configuration file manually ? For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what setting ? Ideally, users shouldn't have to. If you let me know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what setting should be made editable, I can add it to the preferences
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dialog.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I had not, but I opened it, because I wanted to see all options
</I>&gt;<i> in case I had not made the best out of the configuration or the gui
</I>&gt;<i> did not show everything. As said, I'm heavy influenced after using
</I>&gt;<i> tracker. (But I don't think tracker had a command to reread the
</I>&gt;<i> configuration file and you had to use the configurator for the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon to recognize the changed options at runtime.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, in recent versions of Pinot, configuration changes are picked up
by the daemon right away.

&gt;&gt;<i> In what case did you have to wait for several minutes ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used catfish to request everything in my &quot;dir:/docs&quot; (42k indexed
</I>&gt;<i> files) and the connection timed out with the following message on
</I>&gt;<i> the console after some seconds:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Debug: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a
</I>&gt;<i> reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send
</I>&gt;<i> a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the
</I>&gt;<i> reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> after the message was displayed, the cpu was still busy for some seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I see. The D-Bus search method is quite basic at the moment and
returns all results in one go. If there's a large number of results,
the reply timeout will kick in while the daemon is still looking for
matches. This won't cancel the query however, and the daemon will keep
searching, which explains why your system was still busy.

&gt;<i> As I now watched the gif animation, I made some tests with the
</I>&gt;<i> following command:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> time pinot-search --max &lt;x&gt; xapian ~/.pinot/daemon &quot;dir:/docs&quot; &gt; /dev/zero
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The machine was more or less idle and had enough free ram. As said
</I>&gt;<i> above, /docs has around 42k indexed files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to note, that times can vary greatly and can double or half
</I>&gt;<i> for the small result numbers. I didn't made a complete test with
</I>&gt;<i> several iterations and computing the average, but the numbers
</I>&gt;<i> should still give some hints:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> I made a second test and piped the result of the 100k result and it
</I>&gt;<i> returned everything as wanted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see, waiting for all results takes over a minute. Giving
</I>&gt;<i> some faster intermediate response (except the busy lights) can help
</I>&gt;<i> a lot. Intermediate results could be for example partial results
</I>&gt;<i> (good) or numbers of results still to fetch (bad, because the user
</I>&gt;<i> has still to wait a minute before he can proceed and maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> first results had already what he wanted or he changed his mind,
</I>&gt;<i> because the query was stupid).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I have some idea as to how to fix this.

&gt;&gt;<i> The browse+filter method described above was actually designed to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with this. Let me know what you think of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said above, I think it's to complex and hidden. The user has
</I>&gt;<i> to use nonintuitive and long ways to make such queries and to walk
</I>&gt;<i> through them (the 100 results per page limit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the user already needs to select the searchengine/location in
</I>&gt;<i> the 'Search Engines' Tab, before he can really use the Live Query
</I>&gt;<i> or stored queries, He should not need to discern betwen stored
</I>&gt;<i> queries in the list and the drop down list, just because the second
</I>&gt;<i> removes the limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay.

&gt;<i> Sidenote: Choosing the searchengine itself should be visible all
</I>&gt;<i> the time, but it takes too much spaces if i want too, maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> dropdown list (but that would possibly disable multiselection, so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know)? Right now I have to open/close the list of
</I>&gt;<i> searchengines some times, because the used search engine changes,
</I>&gt;<i> which is not visible, if it is not open. But if I don't close it,
</I>&gt;<i> it wastes a lot of space the time I don't need it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, the engines tree can take quite a bit of room. You can resize the
pane to be as wide as you want it to be though.

&gt;<i> Your program is great, so I enjoyed the time working the stuff out.
</I>&gt;<i> My mail is already long enough and I don't know what to write
</I>&gt;<i> anymore. If there is something else I will send another mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for that.
The next step for me will be to come up with a list of changes and see
which I can fit in my next scrum.

By the way, there's a bug in 0.88 that may have prevented all your
plain text and XML files from being fully indexed. 0.89 fixes that but
the daemon will automatically rebuild the index. For you that would
mean another 2 days... If this is not desirable, you could stop the
daemon, upgrade to 0.89 and then, say, touch all those files to update
their timestamps. Finally, start the 0.89 daemon manually with the
&quot;-i, --ignore-version&quot; parameter. This should ensure only those files
are reindexed.

Cheers.

Fabrice
