<PRE>Hi John,

On Thu, Oct 9, 2008 at 11:51 PM, John Werden &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pinot-discuss">johnny666 at email.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> If I want to change the setting for max watched files, do I need it large enough for pinot to watch
</I>&gt;<i> all directories or every single file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It needs to be as large as the number of files. This limit is
specified in /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
If you know directory /docs/A has files that rarely change, whereas
files in /docs/B change all the time, you could add them separately to
the list of directories to index, with Monitor being set to off for A
and on for B
I reckon the daemon could be a bit more clever about what it monitors,
especially if it already knows the corpus.

&gt;<i> A real problem is that the file check on startup takes around 2.5 hours to finish. I know it has to check a lot of files for updates, but I think there is a lot of room for improvements. It may not compare, but a du -a on all the directory trees in question takes only 5 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As you say, it's not entirely comparable because the daemon has to
check its history database. No doubt it could be made faster though...
On top of that, it may perform some additional checks and cleanup, a
&quot;full scan&quot;. This is activated at startup randomly. The log in
~/.pinot will have something like &quot;&quot;Doing a full scan on /a/b/c&quot;.

&gt;<i> It's the size of the whole index:
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; 770M
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> testet xapian-compact on a copy (took maybe 10 minutes):
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; 598M
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Do full text searches return the documents you expect ? I am concerned
you may have hit the bug I mentioned earlier and your text/XML
documents are not fully indexed.

&gt;&gt;<i> - it's not practical to show thousands of results in the results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tree/list. The GUI would become sluggish and unresponsive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that holds true. I use another program written in gtk2 which shows a log in a table and the log can be several thousand lines long without any problem. The only slowdown which occurs is while the program loads a log, because it first loads the COMPLETE log into the table before it displays anything. If the log in question is 100k lines long, building the table will take a few seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hmm ok. I guess I should give it another try...

&gt;<i> Sidenote: What the frontend needs is a 'Open Directory' Option, not only the 'Open File' Option (Right Click Menu). I needed it already and its painful to live without it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Should that option open the directory the selected file lives in, in
your file manager ?

&gt;<i> I think the change from 0.88 to 0.89 is too small for me to consider a reindex. If pinot supports more file types, I will do it. Indexing for every little new supported filetype (except pinot automates the process and does it itself) sounds like a waste of time. As pinot allows reindexing of files in query results, I could query all files with for example the same file extension and force a reindex of them in the frontend without a problem if I feel the need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Actually, trying to index a result that's already been indexed will
not update it. I can't remember what the thinking behind this was, but
the TODO file has had a note about this for a while.
