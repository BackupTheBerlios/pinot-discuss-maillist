&gt;<i> In the list of directories to index, if the Monitor checkbox is
</I>&gt;<i> activated for your docs directory, Pinot will attempt to monitor all
</I>&gt;<i> files in that directory. There's a limit on the number of files a
</I>&gt;<i> process can watch with inotify, so most probably not all your 400k
</I>&gt;<i> files will be watched. The Status window won't show any error for this
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>
That is ok for me, as I can assume that in the next 1-2 years the 
kernel will see some improvements in that area. monitoring large 
quantities of files is still in its infancy under linux.

If I want to change the setting for max watched files, do I need it 
large enough for pinot to watch all directories or every single 
file?

A real problem is that the file check on startup takes around 2.5 
hours to finish. I know it has to check a lot of files for updates, 
but I think there is a lot of room for improvements. It may not 
compare, but a du -a on all the directory trees in question takes 
only 5 minutes.

&gt;<i> I agree, and will look into changing how alternative spellings are suggested.
</I>
Thanks.

&gt;<i> Is that the size of the spelling database at
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.pinot/daemon/spelling.DB ? What about the whole index ?
</I>&gt;<i> How much space do your documents take on the disk, altogether ?
</I>&gt;<i> If your documents collection is static, you could try compacting the
</I>&gt;<i> index at ~/.pinot/daemon with xapian-compact. See the FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/pinot/trunk/FAQ">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/pinot/trunk/FAQ</A>). It will take a long a
</I>&gt;<i> while to compact such a big index though.
</I>
It's the size of the whole index:

213M position.DB
3.4K position.baseA
3.4K position.baseB
331M postlist.DB
5.1K postlist.baseA
5.1K postlist.baseB
  64M record.DB
1005 record.baseA
1005 record.baseB
141M termlist.DB
2.2K termlist.baseA
2.2K termlist.baseB
  23M value.DB
  365 value.baseA
  365 value.baseB

=&gt; 770M

testet xapian-compact on a copy (took maybe 10 minutes):

$ xapian-compact -m daemon2 daemon3

postlist: Reduced by 45.621% 154520K (338704K -&gt; 184184K)
record: Reduced by 6.62472% 4296K (64848K -&gt; 60552K)
termlist: Reduced by 7.33255% 10536K (143688K -&gt; 133152K)
position: Reduced by 2.55269% 5552K (217496K -&gt; 211944K)
value: Reduced by 7.11268% 1616K (22720K -&gt; 21104K)
spelling: Size unchanged (0K)
synonym: Size unchanged (0K)


207M position.DB
   13 position.baseA
3.3K position.baseB
180M postlist.DB
   13 postlist.baseA
2.9K postlist.baseB
  60M record.DB
   13 record.baseA
  965 record.baseB
131M termlist.DB
   13 termlist.baseA
2.1K termlist.baseB
  21M value.DB
   13 value.baseA
  348 value.baseB

=&gt; 598M

&gt;<i> - it's not practical to show thousands of results in the results
</I>&gt;<i> tree/list. The GUI would become sluggish and unresponsive.
</I>
I don't think that holds true. I use another program written in 
gtk2 which shows a log in a table and the log can be several 
thousand lines long without any problem. The only slowdown which 
occurs is while the program loads a log, because it first loads the 
COMPLETE log into the table before it displays anything. If the log 
in question is 100k lines long, building the table will take a few 
seconds.

&gt;<i> - for full text searches, usually the desired documents are in the top
</I>&gt;<i> 10 or 20 results.
</I>&gt;<i> - search mode is designed for viewing results, comparing results
</I>&gt;<i> between engines, digging deeper with More Like or Search This For, and
</I>&gt;<i> indexing results locally
</I>&gt;<i> - browse mode is designed for exploring the corpus, viewing documents
</I>&gt;<i> and editing their properties (labels, metadata...)
</I>
Ultimately different users have different workstyles. For example, 
I do broad searches most times and refine my queries with the 
results to get a better list. For fun I do several searches at the 
same time in different directions. Most times I have unique 
searches or just expect (like if you enter something into a form on 
the interwebs) that the textbox displays all the previous search 
terms, which I will just select incase I entered that term once 
before. As I don't know which search queries I will use in the 
future, I don't store them beforehand.

Sidenote: What the frontend needs is a 'Open Directory' Option, not 
only the 'Open File' Option (Right Click Menu). I needed it already 
and its painful to live without it.

&gt;<i> By the way, there's a bug in 0.88 that may have prevented all your
</I>&gt;<i> plain text and XML files from being fully indexed. 0.89 fixes that but
</I>&gt;<i> the daemon will automatically rebuild the index. For you that would
</I>&gt;<i> mean another 2 days... If this is not desirable, you could stop the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon, upgrade to 0.89 and then, say, touch all those files to update
</I>&gt;<i> their timestamps. Finally, start the 0.89 daemon manually with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;-i, --ignore-version&quot; parameter. This should ensure only those files
</I>&gt;<i> are reindexed.
</I>
I think the change from 0.88 to 0.89 is too small for me to 
consider a reindex. If pinot supports more file types, I will do 
it. Indexing for every little new supported filetype (except pinot 
automates the process and does it itself) sounds like a waste of 
time. As pinot allows reindexing of files in query results, I could 
query all files with for example the same file extension and force 
a reindex of them in the frontend without a problem if I feel the 
need.
