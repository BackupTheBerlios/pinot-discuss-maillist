<PRE>Hi Fabrice

&gt;<i> As you say, it's not entirely comparable because the daemon has to
</I>&gt;<i> check its history database. No doubt it could be made faster though...
</I>&gt;<i> On top of that, it may perform some additional checks and cleanup, a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;full scan&quot;. This is activated at startup randomly. The log in
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.pinot will have something like &quot;&quot;Doing a full scan on /a/b/c&quot;.
</I>
The log with 3.5 hours got overwritten, so I can't say anything about that.
The newer logs don't contain a 'full scan' or similar line. If the machine is
more or less idle, it takes around 30-35 minutes to check everything, under
full load 2+ hours.

&gt;<i> Do full text searches return the documents you expect ? I am concerned
</I>&gt;<i> you may have hit the bug I mentioned earlier and your text/XML
</I>&gt;<i> documents are not fully indexed.
</I>
I checked the problem and it appears the content of textfiles didn't get
indexed. Tried with several commen and not common words from selected textfiles
and all searches failed.

&gt;<i> Should that option open the directory the selected file lives in, in
</I>&gt;<i> your file manager ?
</I>
Yes, it should open the directory where the files live in with the default file
manager (or the directory itself, if you use the option on a directory.)

&gt;<i> Actually, trying to index a result that's already been indexed will
</I>&gt;<i> not update it. I can't remember what the thinking behind this was, but
</I>&gt;<i> the TODO file has had a note about this for a while.
</I>
Yes, read that. Maybe something about internet searches?

John
