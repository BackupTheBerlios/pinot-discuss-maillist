Subject: [Pinot-discuss] Testing pinot 0.70 on Zenwalk 4.4
Message-ID: <45F009C7.3020300@corporateeurope.org>

Dear Fabrice,

I'm testing pinot running it via gdb as you suggested on the zenwalk 
forum. Unfortunately, I can't put too much time into this right now and 
will be away for my job the next two days. But I promise that I will 
make some time to test and experiment with this configuration early next 
week.

Kind greetings,

Erik

I installed Zenwalk and took a look.
A summary of issues I found is here
http://support.zenwalk.org/index.php/topic,6806.0.html
Until the official packages are updated, use the packages at
http://www.chez.com/colinf/pinot/

Let us know if you experience any problem.

Fabrice,

I installed the packages from your website and it works super and so far 
without problems.It is very quick, and finds the things I want to find.

One question: when and for how long the indexing daemon is started up?

I use Thunderbird as mail client and am not sure if I can use the 
"search mbox" option. If that would also work fine, your program is a 
perfect solution for me. Thanks a lot!

That's good to hear :-)

It should be started automatically whenever you login into XFCE. I am not
running Zenwalk right now, but I think there's a "Startup Programs" panel
somewhere in the Preferences menu that shows what programs are started
upon login : pinot-dbus-daemon should be in that list. It will run in the
background for as long as you stay logged in, or until it is killed, or signaled
to quit.
When it starts up, it goes through the locations you have configured for
indexing and indexes new or modified files. Depending on how many there
are it will cause some disk activity for a little while.

Here for instance, my Thunderbird mail boxes are located under
"/home/fabrice/.thunderbird/zd2u8mz5.default/Mail".
The directory is likely to be very similar for you. The easiest is for you to
create a symlink somewhere else in your home directory, eg :
$ ln -s /home/fabrice/.thunderbird/zd2u8mz5.default/Mail/ ~/ThunderbirdMail
then add mail boxes you are interested in to the second list in the Indexing tab
of the Preferences window, using the Add button.
Next time the daemon starts up, it should index these mail boxes.

I hope this makes sense. Let us know if you need more information.

Cheers.

The file is /etc/xdg/autostart/pinot-dbus-daemon.desktop
I will check what panel is called next time I use Zenwalk, it may not be
Startup Services...

Search results will be individual messages. They can be open using the View
menu.
I have just found a bug in the mail filter that causes attachments to not be
numbered correctly, which may prevent you from opening some messages.
A fix will be in 0.71, but I am not definite as to when it will be out yet.

Thanks for the offer. Would you be able to help with translations ?
Pinot uses Rosetta to manage translations, at :
https://launchpad.net/pinot/trunk/+pots/pinot
You would have to create an account on launchpad.net to be allowed to edit
message strings online. The Dutch translation for instance is not yet complete.

Cheers.
