Okay. I realize the current mechanism is far from ideal and can be
disruptive. Would it be less disruptive if the spelling suggestion was
displayed inline, in the results list. A click on it would then create
a corrected stored query.

Did you find indexing was much slower with spelling enabled ? How much
bigger was your index at ~/.pinot/daemon when spelling was enabled ?

As you noticed, the "Live query" is limited to 10 results and there's
no way to increase the value. It sounds like I need to let users
remove the limit on the number of results, for both "Live query" and
stored queries.
Did you try using stored queries to filter the index list while
browsing. If you choose the "Index, List Contents Of My Documents"
menu, this will list all your documents. This list can be filtered
with a stored query, using the combo box next to the Previous and Next
buttons. In this case, the query's maximum number of results doesn't
apply. This should allow you to get the complete list of documents
matching the query.

That's true, especially if the daemon is busy. I will look into fixing this.

Standalone, as in a separate program ? This can be done.

Did you find you had to edit the configuration file manually ? For
what setting ? Ideally, users shouldn't have to. If you let me know
what setting should be made editable, I can add it to the preferences
dialog.

Okay, that's fair enough. Only queries coming though the D-Bus
interface are handled by the daemon; queries run through the Pinot UI
are handled there.

In what case did you have to wait for several minutes ?
I'd be interested to know what kind of query takes that long, and how
many results out of your 400k this query brought back. Do you have
that information ?
I think what you suggest may be possible, I'll have to look into it.

Sure. I was planning to work on this in the near future.

The browse+filter method described above was actually designed to help
with this. Let me know what you think of it.

Okay, I will look into simplifying those.

The stats shown in the status window can be had on the command-line,
using dbus-send. The 2nd screencast at
http://pinot.berlios.de/screenshots.html shows how this is done, even
though the version the screencast was generated with only returned the
number of crawled documents and the number of documents in the index.
See how the GetStatistics method is used at
http://pinot.berlios.de/documentation.html
I agree this could definitely be improved. What other interaction did
you have in mind ?

Okay, that's fair enough.

Thanks for taking the time to email us with these suggestions. This
kind of feedback is exactly what I am after. Let me know if the above
makes sense or if I have missed anything.

Cheers.
