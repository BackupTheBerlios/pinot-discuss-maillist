Message-ID: <CAHcXvYa7fNnyNipxAb9xUonkUTZZ0jXcNiUAAdn3gisUNYqLFg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'm using Pinot 0.95, since that is latest version available on the
repositories of my Linux. I run Bodhi Linux 1.2, which is based on
Ubuntu Lucid 10.04.
Your Homepage lists "editing of metadata" as a feature of Pinot.
Also the following site lists Pinot as "allowing for user tagging":
http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Comparison_of_desktop_search_software
Can you help me make use of this function? How do I access it?
I haven't found instructions in the Readme file.
Thanks, Ben

In the UI, the menu Options, List Contents Of, My Documents will show
what documents were indexed based on your preferences. Double-clicking
on them or using the File, Properties menu will open the properties window
where you will be able to edit metadata (title, language) and assign labels.
Labels are configured in Edit, Preferences and allow for tagging documents.
For instance, documents tagged with label "New" can be retrieved with the
query "label:New". On the command-line, pinot-label allows getting and
settings labels on files. Have a look at the man page.

I hope this helps.

Subject: [Pinot-discuss] Labels in Pinot and other questions
Message-ID: <CAHcXvYY1gfvLOTFXMp+aNob0zbYs5RNS9jagOo_m3DhOetr95g@mail.gmail.com>

Thank you Fabrice, this helped very much.

Still more questions though, in order of importance for me:
 1.) Are Labels saved as properties of the file, or are they kept in a
separate location? I ask this because:  If I transfer a copy of a file
tagged by Pinot to another computer, will the Labels remain available
for indexing to Pinot, or another search engine, if present on that
other computer?

 2.) Can I assign multiple tags to a file?
If yes, what would a query for multiple tags look like, e.g. I want
documents with *all three* of the tags: "New", "Politics" and
"Europe"?
Would I have to go "label:New AND label:Politics AND label:Europe", or
is there a shorter way to do it?
(I went through the man page, As far as I understood it lists only the
commands for terminal. Here I'm asking about what the query should
look like in the UI search field.)

 3.) Some things I'm not sure I understand from the README:

"The values of "file", "url", "dir" and "label" may be double-quoted."
- What is the double quoting for?

"It's also worth pointing out that the query "dir:/X/Y" will return
files and directories
  located in /X/Y, but not Y itself, which is what "dir:/X file:Y" would do."
- In the 2nd example, is Y still a directory? If yes, do I still have
to "dir:X FILE:Y", and it will return a directory?

 4.) I cannot access the Pinot Settings from Edit>Preferences, nothing
happens when I click that. The Settings are only available to me in
the menu of my OS'es system settings.

Thank you very much, Ben

They are stored separately, in the database at ~/.pinot/history-daemon
Pinot does support extended filesystem attributes, but for a reason I
can't recall,
labels aren't currently saved as extended attributes.
I will look into that for the next release...

Files may have any number of tags/labels.
The above query would do the job. Since AND is the default operator,
you should get the same results with "label:New label:Politics label:Europe".

It's to help with spaces. Query elements are space separated.
If you want to look for a file called "Some Thing Here", you will have to
double-quote the value in the query string.
For instance, 'file:"Some Thing Here"'

In the second example, Y can be a directory.
Yes, "dir:/X FILE:Y" will return /X/Y only.

Does /usr/bin/pinot-prefs exist ? It should be symlinked to /usr/bin/pinot
Maybe the Ubuntu package is missing this symlink ?

I hope this helps.
