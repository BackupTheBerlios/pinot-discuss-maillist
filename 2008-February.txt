Subject: [Pinot-discuss] How much memory pinot-dbus-daemon should get ?
Message-ID: <81c921f30802270211y49dab095r7ecbf86264ef2021@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed pinot yesterday on my debian sid box.

Today I can see at my top sorter by memory pinot-dbus-daemon the first:
 PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+
COMMAND
 9723 javi      35  15  476m 323m 3624 S    0 32.2  38:28.18 pinot-dbus-daem


The directories I'm indexing have 37 GB my home and 420 M my /usr/share/doc

How much memory for pinot-dbus-daemon is expected (I think 320m is too big)
?

How much disk space ? (5 %)?

Thank you

It's hard to say. How many documents does Pinot say you have in your
"My Documents" ? Can you also run "du -hsc ~/.pinot/daemon/*" and
report the output ?

I admit I haven't spent much time looking into memory usage. Andreas
Wagner asked a similar question back in November and I wasn't of
much help at the time ;-) Apologies to Andreas by the way.
Take a look at the "Index huuuge" thread here :
https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/pinot-discuss/2007-November/thread.html

I haven't seen the daemon use as much memory so would agree with
you it's too much. Here, for instance, I use it to index documents that take
18Gb of disk space. Not all of them are text documents. After indexing
them all, the daemon uses 120Mb of memory.
Anyway, the good news is that once your documents have been indexed,
subsequent runs will consume much less memory. If you restart the
daemon (see the README for details), it should only use a reasonable
amount.

By the way, 0.82 has a bug that prevents the daemon from indexing
all documents in one swoop. 0.83 should be out in a few days time.
Once the Debian package has been updated to 0.83, would you be
able to try this again and reindex from scratch ?

Currently my .pinot/daemon directory has 1.5 G (~ 5% of my home). I will
count how many documents are on "My documents" on Monday (when I'll return
from my hollidays)

I'll try reindex with 0.83 when it hits sid and I'll post the result in this
thread

Thank you

Ok. If you open pinot, and either go to the Session, Status menu or
use Index, List Contents Of, My Documents, you will see immediately
how many documents there are in the Status window, or in the status
bar at the bottom.
