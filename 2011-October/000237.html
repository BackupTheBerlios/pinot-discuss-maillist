<PRE>Hi,
I'm relatively new to Linux. I used Pinot on previous PC with Ubuntu 11.04
and everything was as it's supposed to be

Now I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on another PC and Pinot 0.96 from Synaptic. I
have `pdftotext` and `djvutxt` programs
In preferences I selected 3 folders for monitoring:

/sympath-to/CHM
/sympath-to/PDF
/sympath-to/DJVU

which root is symbolic link, and another folder:

/path-to/PDF

Now I'm almost sure that symbolic links have nothing to do with my problem
as I didn't have any problems before, but I thought to explain in details
anyway.

Problem is that Pinot indexes only CHM files.
When I launch GUI and choose to see indexed documents, only CHM files are
present.
I double checked with search for terms present in PDF files and I got no
results.
However I noticed that `pdftotext` indexes files with `top` tool or `System
Monitor` in couple of occasions, like on system start-up, or when I close
Pinot GUI configuration or on idle I guess

So what can be issue here? Maybe if fails on some file or similar but where
are already indexed files? Not mentioning DjVu files.

Also I would like to ask another question if you don't mind - as Recoll uses
same search engine and db I got idea to use both tools in some configuration
that suites me best.

Currently Recoll indexes my files (same as those set in Pinot)
Recoll doesn't have index daemon (though I could make incrond action)

Is there some best way of using both indexers without doing things twice?


Thanks in advance
