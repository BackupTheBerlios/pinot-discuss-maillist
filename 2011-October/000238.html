<PRE>Hello Klonuo,

On Tue, Oct 11, 2011 at 2:35 AM, Klonuo Umom &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pinot-discuss">klonuo at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I'm relatively new to Linux. I used Pinot on previous PC with Ubuntu 11.04

</I>&gt;<i> Now I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on another PC and Pinot 0.96 from Synaptic. I

</I>&gt;<i> In preferences I selected 3 folders for monitoring:
</I>&gt;<i> /sympath-to/CHM
</I>&gt;<i> /sympath-to/PDF
</I>&gt;<i> /sympath-to/DJVU
</I>&gt;<i> which root is symbolic link, and another folder:
</I>&gt;<i> /path-to/PDF
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm almost sure that symbolic links have nothing to do with my problem
</I>&gt;<i> as I didn't have any problems&#160;before, but I thought to explain in details
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is that Pinot indexes only CHM files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Is there anything that distinguish your CHM files from your PDF and DJVU files ?
Permissions, maybe ?
Note that the actual content of CHM files can't be indexed by current
releases. A CHM filter is planned for version 0.98.

&gt;<i> When I launch GUI and choose to see indexed documents, only CHM files are
</I>&gt;<i> present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Is this with the List Contents Of, My Documents menu ?

&gt;<i> I double checked with search for terms present in PDF files and I got no
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Did you try looking for PDF files specifically ? For instance
&quot;ext:pdf&quot; will return files with extension &quot;.pdf&quot;.

&gt;<i> However I noticed that `pdftotext` indexes files with `top` tool or `System
</I>&gt;<i> Monitor` in couple of&#160;occasions, like on system start-up, or when I close
</I>&gt;<i> Pinot GUI configuration or on idle I guess
</I>&gt;<i> So what can be issue here? Maybe if fails on some file or similar but where
</I>&gt;<i> are already indexed files? Not mentioning DjVu files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Try the following :
- double check the patterns list in the Indexing tab of Preferences
doesn't exclude the extensions you are interested in (eg &quot;*.pdf&quot;).
- verify that /etc/pinot/external-filters.xml has entries for
&quot;application/pdf&quot; and &quot;image/vnd.djvu&quot;. You may want to try running
the corresponding &quot;command&quot; element manually in the shell against any
of the files you expect to be indexed, and see what the output looks
like. For instance, &quot;pdftotext -enc UTF-8 -raw PDF_FILE_HERE -&quot;
- make sure these files are readable for the user account for which
the Pinot daemon runs.
- look for suspicious messages or errors in the Options, Status window
and in the daemon's log at ~/.pinot/pinot-dbus-daemon.log

&gt;<i> Also I would like to ask another question if you don't mind - as Recoll uses
</I>&gt;<i> same search engine and db I got idea to use both tools in some configuration
</I>&gt;<i> that suites me best.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently&#160;Recoll indexes my files (same as those set in Pinot)
</I>&gt;<i> Recoll doesn't have index&#160;daemon&#160;(though I could make incrond action)
</I>&gt;<i> Is there some best way of using both indexers without doing things twice?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, Recoll and Pinot both use Xapian.
Any Xapian index can be added as an external index to Pinot, using the
big &quot;+&quot; button at the bottom of the Search Engines pane, so you could
actually query indexes built with Recoll from the Pinot UI.
That's as far as it goes; last I heard files were not indexed by
Recoll in the same manner as in Pinot. Simple free text queries
against Recoll indexes should work, but those with filters may or may
not work.

If you think that Pinot misses any feature that Recoll currently has,
let me know. I could look into implementing it.
