<PRE>&gt;<i> The problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At first I used pinot with dictionary enabled, before i rebuilt my
</I>&gt;<i> index with a disabled dictionary. What I found out before I disabled it
</I>&gt;<i> thought, was that the frontend had a liking to annoy the user anytime
</I>&gt;<i> with its corrections about the search term and 'popped up' the prepared
</I>&gt;<i> query list showing a corrected search term (I closed it, because I
</I>&gt;<i> don't need it and it wastes space on my screen).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be better to remove that annoyance, it's like what
</I>&gt;<i> google does, when you enter an unusual search term and it wants to tell
</I>&gt;<i> you that it knows everything better. Maybe using a query option to
</I>&gt;<i> search for similar terms in the dictionary and/or list similar queries
</I>&gt;<i> at request would be less intrusive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay. I realize the current mechanism is far from ideal and can be
disruptive. Would it be less disruptive if the spelling suggestion was
displayed inline, in the results list. A click on it would then create
a corrected stored query.

Did you find indexing was much slower with spelling enabled ? How much
bigger was your index at ~/.pinot/daemon when spelling was enabled ?

&gt;<i> The second problem I got, is that pinot always seems to show only 10
</I>&gt;<i> results even thought there are a lot more. I want to harvest through a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of files and getting only 10 and not several thousand i need (and
</I>&gt;<i> want to scroll through at one time and not flip pages) does not help
</I>&gt;<i> me. I checked out the configuration dialog for stored queries which
</I>&gt;<i> only allows up to 100 results, but I don't use it, so I don't care
</I>&gt;<i> about that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As you noticed, the &quot;Live query&quot; is limited to 10 results and there's
no way to increase the value. It sounds like I need to let users
remove the limit on the number of results, for both &quot;Live query&quot; and
stored queries.
Did you try using stored queries to filter the index list while
browsing. If you choose the &quot;Index, List Contents Of My Documents&quot;
menu, this will list all your documents. This list can be filtered
with a stored query, using the combo box next to the Previous and Next
buttons. In this case, the query's maximum number of results doesn't
apply. This should allow you to get the complete list of documents
matching the query.

&gt;<i> The third is related to the status window. If I open the status window,
</I>&gt;<i> the pinot frontend freezes everytime it fetches the new status from the
</I>&gt;<i> daemon for several seconds or longer (no redraw, no scrolling possible),
</I>&gt;<i> which makes it hard to follow the status change of the daemon or use
</I>&gt;<i> the main window at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's true, especially if the daemon is busy. I will look into fixing this.

&gt;<i> What I think where pinot should improve (heavily influenced by prior
</I>&gt;<i> tracker usage):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - the configuration dialog should be standalone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Standalone, as in a separate program ? This can be done.

&gt;<i> - the configuration file should be more human readable (like tracker
</I>&gt;<i>  with ini-style/helpful comments).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Did you find you had to edit the configuration file manually ? For
what setting ? Ideally, users shouldn't have to. If you let me know
what setting should be made editable, I can add it to the preferences
dialog.

&gt;<i> - the user should be able to see what the daemon does right now
</I>&gt;<i>  (indexing, handling queries and which queries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, that's fair enough. Only queries coming though the D-Bus
interface are handled by the daemon; queries run through the Pinot UI
are handled there.

&gt;<i> - for large requests, pinot should send partial answers as it fetches
</I>&gt;<i>  the results, instead of letting the user wait for maybe several
</I>&gt;<i>  minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>In what case did you have to wait for several minutes ?
I'd be interested to know what kind of query takes that long, and how
many results out of your 400k this query brought back. Do you have
that information ?
I think what you suggest may be possible, I'll have to look into it.

&gt;<i> - the user should be able to abort the execution of queries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure. I was planning to work on this in the near future.

&gt;<i> - pinot should work with LARGE results. I want to walk through possible
</I>&gt;<i>  thousands of files per query and i don't want to set an upper limit of
</I>&gt;<i>  results (in other words: worst case with all indexed files as result).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The browse+filter method described above was actually designed to help
with this. Let me know what you think of it.

&gt;<i> - the system is too techy. I don't even know which search engine is
</I>&gt;<i>  used for &quot;my documents&quot; if I want to use pinot-search. (Yes, it is in
</I>&gt;<i>  the documentation and i read it, but if i have to reread the
</I>&gt;<i>  documentation everytime i want to use the console tools instead of
</I>&gt;<i>  the gtk frontend, it becomes a hassle). Remembering the syntax for
</I>&gt;<i>  search queries was not a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, I will look into simplifying those.

&gt;<i> - there are no small command line tools like tracker-status/stats which
</I>&gt;<i>  print out the status of the daemon or allow to interact with him
</I>&gt;<i>  beyond search and index.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The stats shown in the status window can be had on the command-line,
using dbus-send. The 2nd screencast at
<A HREF="http://pinot.berlios.de/screenshots.html">http://pinot.berlios.de/screenshots.html</A> shows how this is done, even
though the version the screencast was generated with only returned the
number of crawled documents and the number of documents in the index.
See how the GetStatistics method is used at
<A HREF="http://pinot.berlios.de/documentation.html">http://pinot.berlios.de/documentation.html</A>
I agree this could definitely be improved. What other interaction did
you have in mind ?

&gt;<i> - The option for disabling the dictionary should be made visible the
</I>&gt;<i>  first time the user starts the configuration dialog and sets the
</I>&gt;<i>  initial configuration for pinot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Okay, that's fair enough.

Thanks for taking the time to email us with these suggestions. This
kind of feedback is exactly what I am after. Let me know if the above
makes sense or if I have missed anything.

Cheers.

Fabrice
