Hi list,
today I wanted to try pinot, have added my documents folder to be indexed and let pinot do its thing. The folder has 
some 3100 files, most of them pdf files. It is 1.5Gb.
But after some time of heavy indexing, I had to kill pinot-daemon because my home dir was short of being full. The 
index occupied 1.6Gb at that time and the gui said it had some 2.600 files indexed.

Is that space usage normal?

Andreas

Are you using Pinot 0.76 with Xapian 1.0.3 ? On Arch Linux ? ;-)

Can you email the output of "du -hsc ~/.pinot/daemon/*" ?

First off, you may want to have a look at the indexing scheme used in v0.76.
It's documented at http://www.xapian.org/docs/termgenerator.html
Note that stemming applies only to documents for which Pinot was able to
detect the language. Pinot also builds a spelling database, which can add up
quite a bit to the size of the index.

The size of the index depends on the nature of the documents corpus. Say,
if all documents cover the same topic and are in the same language, they will
share a lot of terms and that should result in a smaller index.

With taking all these into consideration, I am surprised that your
index is bigger
than the source documents. That's not something I have seen so far... To give
you an idea, I have a 700Mb index based on 40k documents, totaling 9Gb
of data. 250Mb is taken by the spelling database.
